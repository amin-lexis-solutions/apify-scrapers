## Project Structure: Monorepo vs. Multiple Repositories

### Current Monorepo Setup

**Pros:**
- **Centralized Control:** Streamlines version control and dependency management.
- **Unified Systems:** Ensures consistent build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Simplified Workflow:** Maintains a cohesive development environment.
- **Integrated Changes:** Facilitates simultaneous updates across components.

**Cons:**
- **Complex Dependencies:** Managing dependencies becomes trickier as the project grows.
- **Longer Build Times:** Larger codebase leads to slower CI/CD cycles.
- **Steep Onboarding:** New developers may struggle with the broad scope of the codebase.

### Potential Multi-Repo Structure

**Pros:**
- **Specialized Focus:** Each repo can concentrate on specific functionalities, simplifying development.
- **Quicker Builds:** Isolated changes lead to faster build and test cycles.
- **Scalable Framework:** Supports a growing team working in parallel without bottlenecks.
- **Smoother Onboarding:** Easier for newcomers to get up to speed with segmented repositories.

**Cons:**
- **More Coordination:** Increased overhead in managing interactions between repositories.
- **Duplicate Efforts:** Each repo may need its own setup, increasing redundancy.
- **Complex Dependencies:** More challenging to manage inter-repo dependencies.
- **Risk of Duplication:** Potential for repetitive code across repositories.

### Considerations for the project

**Factors to Consider:**
- **Project Size:** If large or expanding, multiple repos might better handle complexity.
- **Team Dynamics:** Large teams or many new hires suggest benefits from segmented repositories.
- **Efficiency:** Long build times currently slow our progress, indicating a need for separate repos.
- **Maintenance:** If dependency management is a headache, simplifying through multiple repositories could be advantageous.
- **Code Sharing:** High levels of shared code might favor a monorepo unless we can effectively package shared resources.

### Recommendations

- **Maintain Monorepo:** If our project and dependencies are manageable, staying with a monorepo offers streamlined management.
- **Consider Multi-Repo:** For scaling and complexity, splitting into multiple repositories can enhance development speed and flexibility.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Keep core components in a monorepo, but spin off independent modules to separate repos to combine benefits and manage growth effectively.

We should evaluate these options in line with our needs and project goals, possibly starting with a phased approach to test the effectiveness of multiple repositories.
